## String Manipulation
- Reverse a String: Write a function to reverse a given string.

- Palindrome Check: Create a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

- Count Vowels and Consonants: Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.

- String Concatenation: Implement a function that concatenates two strings without using any built-in string concatenation functions.

- Anagram Detection: Write a function that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters with the same frequency).

- String Compression: Implement a function to perform basic string compression by replacing repeated characters with a count (e.g., "aabcccccaaa" becomes "a2b1c5a3").

- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.

- Valid Parentheses: Implement a function to determine if a given string of parentheses is valid (e.g., "{[()]}").

- String Rotation: Write a function to check if one string is a rotation of another string (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").
 
- First Non-Repeating Character: Find the first non-repeating character in a given string.

- Implement a Basic Calculator: Create a program that can evaluate simple arithmetic expressions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) provided as strings.

- Word Reversal in a Sentence: Write a function to reverse the order of words in a sentence while maintaining the order of words themselves.

- Longest Common Prefix: Given an array of strings, find the longest common prefix among them.
 
- Implement a Basic Text Editor: Design a simple text editor that supports operations like insert, delete, undo, and redo.

- Find All Anagrams in a String: Given a string (s) and a non-empty string (p), find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.
